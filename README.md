<br>How to download this map:
<ul>
<li>Click on the green button that says "Code".</li>
<li>Click on "Download ZIP".</li>
<li>Unzip the file.</li>
<li>Note that in the folder called "World-War-I-1914-Tournament-Rules-main", there is another folder with the same name. One of them needs to be removed. To do this, click on the second folder, cut it, go back to the main folder, and paste. It should have replaced the main folder with the folder inside.</li> 
<li>Unzip the file called "map.zip", which is inside the main folder.</li>
<li>Make sure to do the same trick with the map folder as you did with the main folder. There should only be one map folder, not two inside each other.</li>
<li>Remove the "-main" from the file name.</li> 
<li>Place the file in your TripleA downloadedMaps folder.</li>
<li>While following these steps, make sure to replace all zipped files with unzipped ones.</li>
</ul>
<br>If you have followed these steps, the map should show up when you click on "Select Game" after having booted up TripleA, under the name "World War I Tournament Rules".
<br>
<br>Enjoy!
